### [On One Arrow](https://github.com/Eirawen/On-One-Arrow)
What will games look like in the future? Games are incredibly interconnected. If you try offloading the adhoc generation of 
Graphical Assets, Networking, Gameplay Mechanics, Writing, Voice and Sound, Level design, World Generation... 
It's just too much. So the hypothesis is to reduce the decision space, as more specialized engines e.g. RPG maker historically have done, but specialized for 
agents to be the interface. 

Via: 
- GameSpec (typed IR)  
- StylePack  
- Seeds  

…and produces a runnable Godot client + authoritative server with reproducible builds.
